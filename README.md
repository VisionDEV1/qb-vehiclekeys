# qb-vehiclekeys | VDEVELOPMENTS VERSION
This is a slight edit to QB-Cores Original QB-Vehiclekeys script. 
The changes are these
- Removed Hotwiring Fuction
- Removed Hotwiring 3D Text
- Now required to lockpick into vehicle + Lockpick once inside to get keys

  Players now have to use the lockpick item to get into the vehicle But also use the item aswell to get keys to the vehicle. This is a much nicer way to lockpick cars then the hotwiring which is loud and annoying | The
  Police call works when a player fails the lockpicking - Same as usual.
